        "Error propagation is the process of determining the uncertainty in a derived quantity based on the uncertainties in the input quantities. Uncertainties can arise from various sources, such as measurement errors, rounding errors, or systematic biases. By propagating uncertainties through a calculation, we can estimate the overall uncertainty in the final result, providing a more accurate and reliable understanding of our data.\n",

        "Mastering error propagation is essential when working with experimental data, especially in fields such as **chemistry, biochemistry**, physics, engineering, and other experimental sciences.

This is something all students that have taken introductory chemistry will probably remember doing.  What we want to do here is further consider the uncertainty given that there is inherent uncertainty in the T, P and V. So, lets take reasonable uncertainties of 0.01 atm, 0.5 C and 1 mL (estimated measured uncertainties).  This would be reported as P = (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.01) atm, V = (1000.0 $\\pm$ 1.0) mL, and T = (25.0 $\\pm$ 0.5) $^o$C.  So, what is the calculated number of moles of gas and *importantly the correct uncertainty* that should be reported?\n"
